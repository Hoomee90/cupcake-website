<h3>What are cupcakes?</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupcake">They're these things!</a>
<h3>The Contest</h3>
<p class="flashy">Last month, we held a contest to see who could make the wackiest cupcakes. Submissions where due before 4/13/09. If you missed the deadline, take confort in the fact you still have a cupcake to eat!</p>
<h3>The Winners</h3>
<p class="flashy">Picking winners was tough. We had 612 submissions, all of which looked delicious! Except for that one with all the dirt. You know who you are. But of course, we could only choose three. So, without further ado, here are the winners of the third annual Callie's Cupcake Competition Containing Confectionaries, Candies and Conviviality</p>
